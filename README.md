# tinyprograms

This is my own version of
[eatonphil's](https://github.com/eatonphil/tinyprograms)
[tinyprograms](https://tinyprograms.org/).

It's the same idea: a collection of tiny programs that may help you learn a
language. Beyond hello world and library calls, all the programs here must be
simple implementations from scratch.

#### Programs

- [RC4](./rc4): The RC4 stream cipher

#### Implementations

A few goals:
1. Any code here is made only for learning purposes, don't use them in
production.
2. There are tons of the same implementations over the internet, use them as
guides.
3. Avoid 3rd-party libraries.
4. Don't use built-in functions if they implement the entire program.

#### Languages

- Python
